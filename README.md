Mining Server Proxy
===================

A simple proxy which supports acting as both a server for work via Stratum and the protocol defined at [https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bips/blob/master/bip-XXXX.mediawiki]. It gets its work via the work protocol defined there, which can be requested from bitcoind using the patchset at [https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/bitcoin/commits/2018-02-miningserver] as well as payout information optionally via the pool protocol defined in the same.
